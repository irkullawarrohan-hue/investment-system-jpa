Investment Management System – JPA Data Model

This project implements a basic investment management data model using Java Persistence API (JPA).

Entities:
1. Customer
2. Advisor
3. Portfolio
4. Investment
5. Holding
6. Transaction

The implementation follows an ER design where customers own portfolios, advisors manage portfolios, and portfolios contain holdings and transactions.
